How to approach Hangman:

Variables represent the state of the game, they should be stored at top of screen

Setup the game state
	Use a JS object to track state
Game needs to generate a word from a list
	Lazily, just start with one word
We need to accept user input to guess the word
	Use the prompt function to get user input
We need to keep track of the number of guesses
	Add user guesses to an array
We need to compare the user guesses to the game word
	I have no idea right now
We need to show the user their game status
	Render a scoreboard on the page


Use an object to track the game state. Instead of random variables, we have one object. Instead of accessing all of them individually, we can keep them bundled together. When a user enters an action, we can adjust our game state accordingly. 

<script>
var gameState = {
	gameWord:"zebra",
	currentGuessedLetter: "",
	currentGuessedWord:"",
	numberofGuesses:0
};

document.onkeyup = function(event) {
	// being lazy in below line, need to use the keycode thing
	var guessedLetter = "a";
	gameState.currentGuessedLetter = guessedLetter;
	gameState.numberofGuesses++;
	renderScoreboard();
};

function renderScoreboard() {
	var scoreboard = document.getElementById("scoreboard");
	scoreboard.innerHTML = gameState.numberofGuesses;
}




</script>

<div class="scoreboard"></div>
